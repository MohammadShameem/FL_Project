There are two R files in this directory, both of them require you have R installed on your system.

They have been prepared as such that you can simply press ctrl-A (select all) and run all lines of codes.

The first file is TrainingML:
This file reads the database, performs Feature Selection on the data and removes the unnecesairy features.
It then performs machine learning on the data and produces an accuracy measure.

The Second file is TrainingFuzzy:
This file reads the database and constructs a Fuzzy Logic System by using instance based learning.
It then performs a 10fold cross validation repeated 3times to make sure its results are accurate.
The last two lines allow you to show a summary of the FLS which shows its membership functions and Rules, and it allows you to plot the membership functions
